        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bicycle theft is a common problem in many cities, especially in places where bicycles are the most important and convenient means of transportation. Toronto is a good example. In Toronto, bicycle theft cases are endless. The case display chart on the website shows that thefts often occur in every community. This problem causes economic losses to the owners and affects social security. Through this collation and analysis of the theft data and in-depth research, we hope to understand the targets and methods of theft and find ways to reduce the occurrence of cases.</p>

        <p>From Figure 1, we can see that the number of bicycle thefts that occur each year is large. Even though there has been a downward trend in recent years, nearly 3,000 bicycles have still been stolen. This is enough for us to pay attention.</p>
        <p>In order to better analyze the trend of bicycle theft, we first focus on the impact of time on the occurrence of theft incidents: Is there a peak period for theft?</p>
        <p>According to Figure 2, we can see that the number of bicycle thefts has increased significantly from June to September every year, especially in July and August. This is a very interesting discovery. Why are these months the "peak period for theft"? According to the article, thieves prefer to steal bicycles when the bicycle owners are indoors and cannot see them, such as in front of cafes, gyms, and cinemas. July and August are early summer, and the weather in Toronto is warm and more suitable for outdoor activities, and June to August is also a student holiday, and the increase in the number of people traveling has led to an increase in bicycles in the city. Especially in the city center of Toronto, there are many universities and high schools, and students are also the main group of people who use bicycles.</p>
        <p>Various factors lead to the existence of the "peak period for theft". So do thieves have specific "preferences" for bicycle types or values?</p>

        <h2>What are their targets?</h2>
        <label for="location-selector">Select Category:</label>

        <p>Unfortunately, detailed data on specific bicycle types or values targeted by thieves is not provided in this article. However, it is commonly known that thieves often prefer high-value bicycles or popular brands that are easier to resell. Features like expensive components, lack of secure locks, or being left unattended for long periods can make a bicycle more attractive to thieves.</p>

      <div id="prevention">
        <h2>How can we prevent bike theft?</h2>
        <p>At present, we have analyzed the high-incidence period, high-incidence area, and the main targets of thieves for bicycle thefts, so how should we apply these analyses to better prevent bicycle thefts? First, patrols should be increased at night and during the high-incidence period. We can see that most bicycle thefts occur at night because it is dark and there are few people at night, making it more difficult to discover. Therefore, the security measures in the community should be strengthened. Secondly, during the high-incidence period, bicycle centralized parking areas should be set up in commercial areas or parks and other places with high traffic volume for easy supervision. These areas need to be monitored or guarded to reduce the risk of theft. Finally, bicycle owners should strengthen their awareness of anti-theft, especially those who are "favored" by thieves. Buying higher-quality anti-theft locks, parking in places with monitoring, and installing GPS locators on bicycles are all good ways.</p>

      <div id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, we observed and analyzed the overall data of bicycle theft in Toronto and understood how frequently this happens and how much attention the public needs to pay. By analyzing the types and values of stolen bicycles, we understand what bicycles are more likely to be stolen and where they are parked. By analyzing the reporting time and the recovered bicycle data, we understand that the bicycle is more likely to be recovered when the theft is reported. We hope these analyses can make Toronto citizens more vigilant about bicycle theft and take effective measures to prevent it.</p>
